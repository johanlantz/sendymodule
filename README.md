# Sendy Newsletter module for Thirtybees
(It should work on Prestashop 1.5->1.6 as well but probably not on 1.7) 

The module is a fork of Iztok Svetik's module from 2013 with the following additions:
1. Nicer UX, some sample images are provided. You need to put your own in the img/lang folders.
2. Support for Sendy 3.0.x features.
3. Support for multiple languages mailing lists. This was the main thing missing if you run a multilanguage shop.

Todo:
* It would be nice to automatically add new customers to a customer list.
